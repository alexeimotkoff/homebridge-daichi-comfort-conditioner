# homebridge-daichi-comfort-conditioner

Homebridge plugin, providing integration of the air conditioner from the application 'Daichi Comfort'.

This plugin is not official and was created by a person not associated with 'Daichi'. Performance was tested only on one air conditioner, which was connected to the Daichi Cloud via the Wi-Fi controller DW22-B. If you have feedback or were able to test the performance on your device, you can contact me: alexeimotkoff@gmail.com

For the plugin to work, you need to enter your username and password for the account to which your air conditioner is linked. After this, the device will be added to your device list.
